                <p>A hatchback is a car body configuration with a rear door that swings upward to provide access to a cargo area.
                    Hatchbacks may feature fold-down second row seating, where the interior can be reconfigured to prioritize passenger
                    or cargo volume. Hatchbacks may feature two- or three-box design. While early examples of the body configuration can
                    be traced to the 1930s, the Merriam-Webster dictionary dates the term itself to 1970. The hatchback body style has been
                    marketed worldwide on cars ranging in size from superminis to small family cars, as well as executive cars and some sports cars.
                    They are a primary component on a sport utility vehicle. source: Wikipedia</p>
