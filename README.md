#### Description: TRUE TRANSLATE is a language converter program made made on python.User can interact with the program using the treminal. The program uses the Google Translate pyhton library for the translate functions. It also uses a csv file for finding the entered desired language and feed the 2 letter code for the same to the translate function. It can also display the entire list of languages available for translation to the useer, To use the program just enter the desired language first, after that enter the text you want to convert.
#### Thats it! The text will be coverted. For some scenerios the the entered langauge may not be available. In that case the program will prompt the user to see the entire list of available languages and again choose the language they want their text to be converted to. User can also choose to ignore the same and move ahead.

## What is Google Translate?
#### Google Translate is a language converter tool by Google Inc. It uses its cross language dictionary along with some modern tools to convert form one language to another. This project I have used this tool with the help of a pyhton library which passes on the language conversion request to Google Translate. Though, Google currently supports more languages than the avaiable languages in this program for conversion, for the scope of this program we will be sticking to given number of languages in this program.
